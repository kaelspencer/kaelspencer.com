                <header>About Me</header>
                <p>I am a software developer at Microsoft. I work in Windows Live in Desktop Communications (Messenger, Mail, etc). I'm on a team that effectively does two things: maintaining an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNP">MSNP</a> session and managing buddy presence. I work soley with C++. I've been at Microsoft since April 2011. I arrived at Microsoft immediately after graduating from Oregon Institute of Technology with a bachelor's in Software Engineering and another bachelor's in Applied Mathematics.</p>
                <p>I have previously worked at Qualcomm. I worked there for three summers (internships), and then throughout my last year of college as a contractor. At Qualcomm I was on a tool development team in a group that did network analysis and optimization. The majority of my work revolved around handling large datasets. There was a mixture of C++, C#, and Perl. As we were a tools team, I was able to work on many other projects as well.</p>
                <p>I hope to become more active in the open source community and with personal projects. If things go according to plan, this website will mainly be a place for me to post projects with a minor discussion on them.</p>
